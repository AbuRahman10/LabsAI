# Lab 1: Search

In this lab you will practice uninformed search (DFS, BFS) on different problems.

## Workflow

1. **Start with the tutorial**  
   - Go to the `tutorial/` folder.  
   - Complete the setup and the three warm-up exercises (Q1â€“Q3).  
   - This will get you familiar with the autograder.

2. **Pacman exercises**  
   - Go to the `pacman/` folder.  
   - Implement DFS and BFS in `search.py`.  
   - Test them using the provided Pacman layouts.  

3. **Riddles exercises**  
   - Go to the `riddles/` folder.  
   - Define the state spaces for the River Crossing and Missionaries & Cannibals problems.  
   - Solve them with your DFS and BFS implementations.
